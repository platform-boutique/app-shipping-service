# Observability

| Signal | Implementation | Destination |
|---|---|---|
| **Traces** | OpenTelemetry (`otelgrpc` handlers), OTLP/gRPC exporter (batch processor, queue bounded at 2048), W3C TraceContext + Baggage propagated to every downstream call. Sampler from `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER` (SDK default `parentbased_always_on`) | Alloy `:4317` -> Tempo |
| **Metrics** | Prometheus default registry: `grpc_server_handled_total`, `grpc_server_handling_seconds_*`, `grpc_server_started_total`, `grpc_server_msg_*`, Go runtime/process. Served as Prometheus text on `:9090/metrics` (`METRICS_PORT`) and, because the same registry is bridged into OpenTelemetry, also pushed over OTLP every 15 s (metric names identical). Plus `build_info{service,version,commit} 1` | Alloy scrapes `:9090` -> Mimir |
| **Logs** | `logrus`, one JSON object per line on stdout, plus an OTLP/gRPC hook (`otellogrus`) | stdout -> Alloy -> Loki; OTLP -> Alloy -> Loki |
| **Profiles** | Pyroscope Go SDK (CPU, alloc/in-use objects and space, goroutines, mutex, block), only with `PYROSCOPE_ADDR`; tags `service_name`, `version`, `environment` | Pyroscope |

**Telemetry contract** (the code is `internal/obs`, the same package in every Go service): telemetry is on only if `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is a valid absolute http(s) URL; `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true` forces everything off (profiling too); profiling only with `PYROSCOPE_ADDR`. Start never waits for the collector (the exporters connect in the background) and on SIGTERM the flush is cut off after 4 s, so a blackholed collector cannot hold the process (unit-tested with a listener that never answers: start and shutdown both return within the bound).

**Resource attributes** on every signal: `service.name` (`OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`, default `shipping-service`), `service.version` (`SERVICE_VERSION`, else build info, else `dev`), `service.namespace=everly`, `deployment.environment` (`DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT`, default `local`), `service.instance.id` (hostname). `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` is applied last.

**Log shape** (one shape for all services): `timestamp` (RFC 3339, UTC, milliseconds), `severity` (`debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`), `message`, `service`, `version`, `trace_id` and `span_id` (hex, only while a valid span is active, never empty or all zeros), `request_id` (when the caller sent one), `error` (string, on errors), plus the call's own fields (for example `order_id`). Level from `LOG_LEVEL`. `trace_id`/`span_id` come from the context of the log call: handlers and clients log with `log.WithContext(ctx)`, the formatter reads the span from it. Calls without a context (startup, background work) have no ids. No card data, tokens or e-mail addresses are logged.

**Startup and version**: the first line is `message: "starting"` with `version`, `commit` and `environment`; `version`/`commit` come from `SERVICE_VERSION`, ldflags `-X <module>/internal/obs.Version=` / `.Commit=`, or the VCS data Go embeds (no Dockerfile change was made: without any of them a container image reports `version: "dev"`, `commit: "unknown"`). Panics are logged as one JSON line (`message: "panic"`, `error`) before the process dies; a startup error is one JSON error line, exit 1.

**pprof** is off. `PPROF_ADDR=127.0.0.1:6060` starts a separate listener; it is never on the metrics port.

**Graceful shutdown** (SIGTERM or SIGINT): the health status turns `NOT_SERVING`, the gRPC server stops accepting and lets in-flight calls finish (`GracefulStop`, forced stop after 5 s), then the telemetry flush runs, cut off after 4 s: the process exits within 9 s even when the collector is blackholed. Run against a listener that never answers (OTLP and Pyroscope both pointed at it) the binary exited 0 about 4 s after SIGTERM (smoke run, not part of the unit tests).

Every series carries `job="shipping-service"` (from `service.name`) and `instance=<pod name>` (`service.instance.id`), which is what the Grafana dashboards select on. Logs land in Loki with `service_name="shipping-service"` and trace/span ids, so a log line links to its trace.
